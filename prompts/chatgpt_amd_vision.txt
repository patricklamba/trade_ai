[Money Management Context - FTMO & MT5 Standardization]

Important for accuracy: 
You are calculating position sizing for a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) environment, using FTMO specifications and CFD contract standards. 
Always use the following pip/lot values for your calculations and explanations.

🔹 **General Rules:**
- Formula: 
  lot_size = (capital * (risk_percent / 100)) / (stop_loss_pips * pip_value_per_lot)
- Round to 2 decimal places, minimum 0.01 lot.

🔹 **FTMO / MT5 Contract Specifications:**

| Asset Type | Symbol Example | Pip Definition | Pip Value (1 lot) | Contract Size | Notes |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Gold (XAUUSD) | XAUUSD | 0.01 = 1 pip | 10 USD/pip | 100 oz | 1$ move = 100 pips = 1,000 USD/lot |
| Major Forex | EURUSD, GBPUSD | 0.0001 = 1 pip | 10 USD/pip | 100,000 units | Standard FX pair |
| Index (US30) | US30, GER40 | 1.0 = 1 point | 1 USD/point | 1 contract | 1 point = 1 USD/lot |
| Crypto (BTCUSD) | BTCUSD | 1.0 = 1 pip | 1 USD/pip | 1 BTC | 1$ move = 1 USD/lot |

🔹 **Risk Examples (FTMO 100k account):**
- Risk 1% = 1,000 USD maximum loss per trade.
- Risk 0.5% = 500 USD maximum loss per trade.

✅ Always calculate lot size precisely using the FTMO/MT5 specification for the given symbol.
Provide both:
1. The **exact lot size** (e.g., “0.45 lots XAUUSD”)
2. The **explanation of the math** used to reach that number.

[AMD TECHNICAL ANALYSIS]

📊 **H4 - AMD Context & Liquidity Zones:**
- **Long-Term Trend:** Identify if H4 shows a clear bullish or bearish trend. Explain briefly.
- **Key Zones of Interest (H4):** Highlight accumulation or distribution areas, with approximate price levels.
- **Liquidity Pools (H4):** Indicate possible liquidity resting areas (old highs/lows).
- **Order Flow Bias (H4):** Describe recent momentum (impulsive or corrective moves).

📉 **M15 - AMD Phase Identification & Trigger:**
- **Current Phase (M15):** Identify if price is in Accumulation, Manipulation, or Distribution.
- **Boundaries (M15):** Define approximate high/low range for current phase.
- **Manipulation Evidence:** Describe any liquidity grab or fake breakout, with approximate price level.
- **Momentum/Volume Clues:** Mention any shift confirming the phase.

🧩 **Overall AMD Narrative:**
- Summarize the story: e.g. “H4 accumulation, M15 manipulation before bullish expansion.”

🎯 **Theoretical Scenario & Invalidation:**
- Define a theoretical scenario including:
  - **Direction:** Buy / Sell / Wait  
  - **Entry Zone:** price or narrow range  
  - **Take Profit 1 (TP1)**  
  - **Take Profit 2 (TP2)**  
  - **Stop Loss (SL):** include clear invalidation level  
  - **Expected Success Probability (%):** based on structure  
  - **Approximate Risk/Reward Ratio (R:R)**  
- **Invalidation:** Describe what would cancel the setup (e.g., break below/above key level).

💰 **Lot Size Calculation (MT5 / FTMO Standard):**
- Using the data above, calculate the appropriate lot size based on:
  - Capital = {capital}
  - Risk per trade = {risk_percent}%
  - Approximate SL distance (in pips)
  - Asset type = {asset_symbol}
- Provide both the **lot size** and **the reasoning**.
