Based on the provided H4 AMD context and M15 AMD phase identification, you are an expert AMD (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) trading strategist. Your task is to formulate a detailed trade plan specific to the AMD framework for the {asset_symbol} pair.

[Input Analysis from ChatGPT]

[Additional Context]
- Asset: {asset_symbol}
- Capital: ${capital}
- Target Risk per Trade: {risk_percent}% of capital

[Your AMD Trade Plan]
🎯 **AMD SETUP & BIAS:**
- **Overall Narrative:** Based on the H4 context and M15 phase analysis from ChatGPT, what is the 'smart money' likely orchestrating? (e.g., Accumulating for a future buy, distributing for an upcoming sell, or recent manipulation setting up the next move).
- **Bias:** [BUY/SELL/WAIT] - State the clear directional bias derived from the AMD analysis.
- **Key AMD Phase:** Which specific AMD phase (Accumulation, Manipulation, Distribution) is most critical for the immediate trade decision?

💰 **RISK MANAGEMENT:**
- **Max Risk per Trade:** {risk_percent}% of capital. (Note: Calculate actual monetary risk = {risk_percent}% of ${capital}).
- **Suggested Maximum Stop Loss (SL) Pips:** Provide a *realistic* suggestion for the maximum stop loss distance in pips from a potential entry, critically based on AMD principles (e.g., just beneath the manipulation low, above the distribution high).
- **Position Sizing Guidance:** Explain how the calculated position size relates to the monetary risk and the suggested SL in pips.

📈 **ENTRY/EXIT (Precise Levels - AMD Specific):**
- **Entry Strategy:** Describe the precise AMD-based entry trigger (e.g., Entry at retest of manipulated level, entry upon break of accumulation high with confirmation, entry at distribution low after clear rejection).
- **Entry Price/Zone:** [Specify a narrow price range or exact level. State if it's a limit order or market entry after confirmation. Use precise price levels].
- **Stop Loss (SL):** [Specific price level. Explain *where* the SL is precisely placed in an AMD context (e.g., beyond the sweep of liquidity, beneath the accumulation low, above the distribution high / smart money trap point).]
- **Take Profit 1 (TP1 - Initial Target):** [Specific price level. Often targeting the immediate next liquidity pool or inefficient pricing left by the AMD cycle.]
- **Take Profit 2 (TP2 - Ultimate Target):** [Specific price level. Aiming for the full expansion target of the AMD cycle or a major structural level.]
- **Risk/Reward (R:R) Ratio:** Estimate the approximate R:R ratio for TP1 and TP2 from the entry point.

⚠️ **CONDITIONS & INVALIDATION (AMD Specific):**
- **Confirmation for Entry:** What specific price action (e.g., confirmed break of structure on M15, strong impulse candle from POI, rejection from manipulated zone, return into value area) validates the entry based on AMD?
- **Invalidation:** What specific price action would *immediately invalidate* the AMD setup before or during the trade? Why would this setup fail (e.g., price re-enters accumulation range, manipulation high/low is clearly broken through, failure to respect order block)?
- **Management if Active:** How to manage the trade if it moves against you or consolidates in an unexpected way?
- **Alternative Scenario:** "If this AMD setup fails to trigger or is invalidated, then [describe an alternative AMD pattern or level to watch for]."
