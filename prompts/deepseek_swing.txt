[Input Analysis from ChatGPT]
{analysis_from_chatgpt}

[Additional Context]
- Asset: {asset_symbol}
- Capital: ${capital}
- Target Risk per Trade: {risk_percent}% of capital

[Your Trade Plan]
🎯 **SETUP & BIAS:**
- **Bias:** Briefly state the directional bias explicitly (e.g., BUY, SELL, or WAIT given current conditions).
- **Reasoning:** Explain *why* this bias is chosen, linking directly to the H4/H1 analysis from ChatGPT.
- **Strategy Type:** Swing Trading. Describe the type of setup (e.g., Trend Continuation Entry, Range Bounce, Pullback to Key Level, Breakout Retest).

💰 **RISK MANAGEMENT:**
- **Max Risk per Trade:** {risk_percent}% of capital. (Note: Calculate actual monetary risk = {risk_percent}% of ${capital}).
- **Suggested Maximum Stop Loss (SL) Pips:** Based on the chart analysis, provide a *realistic* suggestion for the maximum stop loss distance in pips from a potential entry. This will be used for position sizing calculation.
- **Position Sizing Guidance:** Explain how the calculated position size relates to the monetary risk and the suggested SL in pips.

📈 **ENTRY/EXIT (Precise Levels):**
- **Entry Zone/Price:** [Specify a narrow price range or exact level. State if it's a limit order or market entry after confirmation. Use precise price levels based on the analysis.]
- **Stop Loss (SL):** [Specific price level derived from the Suggested SL Pips and entry. Explain *why* this level is chosen (e.g., below key support, above key resistance, market structure invalidation point).]
- **Take Profit 1 (TP1):** [Specific price level for partial profit-taking. Explain its basis (e.g., next resistance, measured move).]
- **Take Profit 2 (TP2):** [Specific price level for full profit-taking, if applicable. Explain its basis.]
- **Risk/Reward (R:R) Ratio:** Estimate the approximate R:R ratio for TP1 and TP2 from the entry point.

⚠️ **CONDITIONS & INVALIDATION:**
- **Confirmation for Entry:** What specific conditions must be met to validate the entry (e.g., specific candle close, break of a level, retest completion, momentum confirmation)?
- **Invalidation:** What price action would *immediately invalidate* the trade setup, suggesting not to enter or to exit early if already in?
- **Adjustments/Market Changes:** How might the trade plan need to adapt if market conditions or sentiment change significantly?
- **"What If" Scenario:** "If price fails to hold [critical level], then [describe alternative action/outlook]."
